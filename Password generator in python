Generate Random Passwords:
Create a function to generate random passwords based on specified criteria (length, character types).
User Interface:Develop a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.
Allow users to specify password length and select character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).
Password Strength Options:Implement options for password strength (e.g., weak, medium, strong) which adjust complexity based on chosen criteria.Security
Considerations:
Ensure secure handling of generated passwords, especially if storing or transmitting them.
Implement hashing and salting if passwords need to be stored securely.
generate_password Function: 
This function generates a random password based on specified parameters (length, use_uppercase, use_digits, use_special). 
It concatenates character sets based on user input and randomly selects characters to form the password.
main Function:
The main function serves as the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to input password criteria such as length, whether to include uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. 
It then calls generate_password with these inputs and prints the generated password.
Customization:
Users can adjust the length of passwords and specify which character types (uppercase, digits, special) to include based on their security requirements.For a more advanced project, 
you could implement additional features such as password strength estimation, password hashing, or integration with a password manager.
Imports: 
We import random for generating random numbers and string for accessing string constants like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation.
generate_password 
Parameters: length specifies the length of the password. By default, it's set to 12
characters.Flags: use_uppercase, use_digits, and use_special are boolean flags that determine whether to include uppercase letters, digits, and special characters (like punctuation) in the generated password.Character
Selection:We start with string.ascii_lowercase, which includes all lowercase letters.Based on the flags, we append additional character sets (string.ascii_uppercase, string.digits, 
string.punctuation) to characters if the corresponding flags are True.Generating the Password:We use a list comprehension with random.choice() to randomly select characters from characters and join them together to form the password string.
Usage:We set password_length to 12 and generate a password using generate_password().Finally, we print the generated password.
